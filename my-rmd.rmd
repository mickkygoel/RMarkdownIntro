Here is some inline code `r 1+1`

##May the force be with you

```{r, starwars-plot, fig.cap = "a ggplot of Starwars data"}

library(tidyverse)

starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
ggplot() +
  aes(x=height,
      y = mass) +
  geom_point()
```

Now see my table

``` {r starwars-tbl}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(name,
  height,
  mass,
  homeworld) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table of starwars data")
```

We can see in plot of data in Figure \@ref(fig:starwars-plot) ...

We can see in Star Wars data in Table \@ref(tab:starwars-tbl)...

...
```{r, myfig, fig.cap = "a pic of Starwars logo"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/og-generic_02031d2b.png?region=0%2C0%2C1200%2C1200")

```
We can see in Star Wars log in Figure \@ref(fig:myfig) ...

These are my in-text citations regarding Star Wars.

In the end, I have included reference list.
